  "musicJourney": "I was born in Rio Grande's suburb, in the inland of Rio Grande do Sul. I'm the youngest daughter of a single mother and I have two brothers and one sister.\n My oldest brother is a musician, and that's how I had my first contact with musical instruments. When I was 15, I learned how to play acoustic guitar by myself. In high school, I started my first all female band, with two of my friends: A New Metal band called Cacofonia, where I used to sing and play guitar. Eventually the band was over, but I’ve moved on doing acoustic concerts at pubs around the city.\n Besides my interest in music, I've always liked to sketch and draw (my middle brother is a very talented artist). Yeah, I'm lucky that I was born in a very talented family. My sister, for example, has always been very great at handicraft, sewing and creative stuff. Today she makes beautiful and fun candies and chocolates to sell over there.\n Everytime I tell people about my story, I end up talking about my family, but I definitely wouldn’t be where I am if it wasn’t for them.\n Anyway, when I was 18, I came out as a lesbian. My mother has always been very supportive. In the following year she gave me a tattoo machine as a birthday gift. After that  I've moved to Tramandaí, close to Porto Alegre, to be near the capital and try to make a living as a musician and tattoo artist, which takes me to the next step of my story...",
  "tattooJourney": "In Tramandaí I lived with my cousin for about 1 year. I was a tattoo artist self-employee at the time, and by the internet I met Kika, a woman guitarist from Porto Alegre who said she has listened to my songs at MySpace and enjoyed it. At some point I met her in person and we started a female band called Electric Mind. With Electric Mind we played at Porto Alegre/Brazil, São Paulo/Brazil and Buenos Aires/Argentina, we had a very great time, but unfortunately we didn't get any money out of it. That's when I started to officially work as a tattoo artist at a studio in Porto Alegre. I've had comings and goings at the studio, because its owner was a very narrow-minded person and I didn't feel comfortable there.\n By the end of 2013, I met and fell in love with Germana, my partner. She has always been by my side and supported me in everything I did. At some point, we felt that Porto Alegre didn't have anything else to offer us. The government changed, the city got violent, so we've decided to try our luck in Florianópolis/Brazil. \n There we founded a tattoo studio called Feminink. The idea was to be a safe and welcoming space to minorities, with all female staff. We were able to keep the studio alive for about 2 years, with me as a tattoo artist and Gê running the business (social medias, events, hosting our customers, etcetera). With the far-right ruining our country, the economy wasn't going well and we were also going through a lot of lesbophobia and misogyny episodes, the things at the studio weren't doing fine. We decided to change the studio's name to Corpo Fechado, since we've noticed that the name Feminink was scaring rather than attracting people.\n Soon, Corpo Fechado also wasn't working and we had to close the doors. With the pandemic my career as a tattoo artist went down the toilet and I've decided to use the lockdown to seek out a new career...",
  "programmingJourney": "I started my developer journey by buying an Android Development Course at the Udemy and started studying on my own. This course had about 100 hours of duration, and when I was getting close to 50% of progress I saw on Instagram a publication about a programming school called Labenu.\n I remember that it was about encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to start a technology career and that really caught my attention. This course was very different from what I was studying before, its main focus was in Web Programming and employability.\n I've applied for their selective process through ISA (Income Share Agreement) and was approved. I've had 6 intense months of practical learnership on programming, facing great challenges, but Labenu has always been a very cozy and safe environment.\n Even before my graduation, by the end of the course, I was already employed and ready to start my first job at technology.\n Today I feel more confident and qualified each day to face the challenges of the market, always seeking to evolve and grow. I'm pretty happy with my journey so far! :)",
